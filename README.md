# Tesladata project stopped
Hi,

I stopped developing Tesladata and started using [TeslaMate](https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate). When you want to have a non-cloud logger for your Tesla, my advice is to checkout [TeslaMate](https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate).

For future reference, this project will be hosted on Github, the previous [README.md](OLD_README.md) is moved to OLD_README.md
